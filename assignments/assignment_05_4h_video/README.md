## 1 - Watch the following video (over 4 hours) and learn:

- https://youtu.be/r-uOLxNrNk8

- The video has 8 parts, you should create 8 separate Jupyter Notebooks, one for each part. You must check in all 8 Jupyter Notebooks.
- As you watch, you create Jupyter Notebooks in Colab and follow along. Pause, run your code, and continue as necessary.
- On YouTube website, below the video, there are clear instructions and also links to Jupyter Notebooks in GitHub.
- You should download the datasets and upload to Google Colab so your Jupyter Notebook has access to the data.
- You can open the trainer's Jupyter Notebook and copy/paste his code if necessary to avoid typing.
- This exercise is to make up for the class and also serve as the homework assignment. 

## 2 - You also need to write a text document using Markdown (.md file).

- In the file, you list and summarize the things (package/module, function/method, tricks, etc.) you have learned from the video. 
- Be as specific and detailed as possible. The file needs to be well formated and styled. It is kind of study notes and can be useful for future or sharing with others.
- Also include how many hours you have spend on this assignment

# Statistical Analysis and Data Visualization with Python
## Course Summary
Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization, and Python Programming All in One Place with Hands-on Practices. 
## My Pedagogy
- I put practice above PowerPoint. I don't focus on syntax or mechanics.
- I share with students how I learn. I show them how to learn a subject on their own so that they become a life-long learner without relying on teachers or gurus. 
- I offer no fishes nor fishing gears. I show then where and how to find them.
- The Internet is the fish pond and Google searches are the fishing gears. 
- Curiocity may kill a cat, it sure make a student.

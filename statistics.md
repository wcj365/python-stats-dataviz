# Outline of Statistics
## 1. Basics
### 1.1 Four Core Concepts
- Population
- Parameter
- Sample
- Statistics
### 1.2 Types of Data
- Categorical/Qualitative
    - Nominal (not ordered)
    - Ordinal (ordered)
- Numerical/Quantitative
    - Discrete (finite counts of values)
    - Continuous (infinite counts of values)
        - Interval (add, subtract)
        - Ratio (divide, multiple, zero)
### 1.3 Sampling
- Nonprobability Sampling
- Probability Sampling
    - Simple Random Sampling with Replacement (A selected unit is placed back in the population and has another chance to be selected again)
    - Simple Random Sampling without Replacement (A selected unit is placed back and hence not eligible to be selected again)
### 1.4 Sources of Data
- Primary Data (Collected first-hand by the researchers)
- Secondary Data (collected by other people)
### 1.5 Types of Research
- Experimental Study
    - Response Variable
    - Treatments/Control Variable
- Observational Study
## 2. Descriptive Statistics
### 2.1 Measure of Centrality
- Mean
    - Weighted Mean
    - Trimmed Mean
    - Geometric Mean
- Median
- Mode
### 2.2 Measure of Dispersion 
- Range
- Variance
- Standard Deviation
- Outlier (unusual observations)
### 2.3 Percentiles
- Quartiles
    - Q1 (25%)
    - Q2 (50%, Median)
    - Q3 (75%)    
- Interquartile Range (IQR) (Q3 - Q1)
### 2.4 Five-Number Summary/Boxplot/Box and Whisker Plot
- Min
- Q1
- Q2
- Q3
- Max
### 2.5 Measure of Association Between Two Variables
- Correlation/Covariance
- Correlation Coefficient (r is between -1 and 1)
## 3. Data Visualization
### 3.1 Categorical Variables
- Frequency Table/Frequency Distribution
    - Relative Frequency (number between 0 and 1 relative to the total count)
    - Percent Frequency ( % of the total count)
- Bar Charts
    - Pareto Charts (Ordered from highest to lowest, may include a dotted line indicating the cumulative relative or percent frequency)
- Pie Charts
### 3.2 Numerical Variables
#### Typical Traits of Interests:
- Central Tendency
- Dispersion
- Shape
- Outliers 
- Trend, Seasonality,and Temporal Dependence
#### Types of Visualizations:
- Dot Plots
- Histograms
- Line Charts
#### Logarithmic Scale (commonly used for economic and financial data)
#### Visualization of Two or More Variables
- Multiple Categorical Variable
    - Contigency Table 
    - Stacked Bar Charts
- Multiple Numerical Variables
    - Stacked Dot Plots
    - Stacked Histograms
    - Scatterplots

## 4. Probability
### 4.1 Basics
- Sample Space
- Elementary Event
    - Complement of an Event
    - Intersection of two Events
    - Mutually exclusive or Disjoint
    - Union of two Events
- Probability of an Event
- Types of Probability
    - Thoretical Probability
    - Empiricial Probability
    - Subjective Probability
- Law of Large Numbers (As observations increases, empiricial probabilities converge to theoretical probabilities)
- Independent Events, Conditional Probability, and Bayes' Theorem
### 4.2 Discrete Random Variables
- Probability Distribution Function (PDF)/Probability Mass Function (PMF)
- Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
- Bernouli Random Variables
- Binomial Random Variables
### 4.3 Continuous Random Variables
- Probability Density Function (PDF)
- Uniform Probability Distribution
- Normal Distributions
- Z Distribution (Standardized Normal Distributions with $\sigma\$ = 1, \miu\ = 0)
## 5. Sample Statistics and Sampling Distribution
### 5.1 Basics
- Population Distribution
- Data Distribution 
- Sampling Distribution
### 5.2 Sample Statistics
- Sample Mean
- Sample Variance
- Sample Standard Deviation
- Samele Standard Error
- Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
## 6. Interval Estimation
### 6.1 Basics
- Point Estimators
- Margin of Errors
- Confidence Interval
- Confidence Level (of Confidence Interval)- 
## 7. Hypothesis Testing
### 7.1 One Population
### 7.2 Two Populations
## 8. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
## 9. Regression
### 9.1 Simple Linear Regression
### 9.2 Multiple Linear Regression
## 10. Time Series and Forcasting
